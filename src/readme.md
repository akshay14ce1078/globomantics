#### THIS PROJECT 
* Main aim is to get hands on expression on `node`, `express` and `mongodb` by creating a small web app.

* we learn how to setup express app, use various middleware, configure template engine, configure and use mongo db & learn about authentication process using `[passport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passport)`.

* In the end we learn how to use `axios` in order to get data from api. In our project we have one `speakers-api` directory (do npm start in that directory, so that it will act like speakers api running on port 3000)

*** KEEP ON LEARNING ***
